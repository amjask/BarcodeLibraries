# BarcodeLibraries
Information related to design of imaging based combinatorial barcode libraries

lib_1e6_oligos.txt contains oligo sequences used in creating a library with >1.5 million image readable barcode combinations.
lib_4e3_oligos.txt contains sequences for a smaller library with ~4000 combinations.
They both use 20bp units which we have found to produce strong signal in our screening.

Instructions for how these libraries are designed can be found in their corresponding notebooks.
